## Features

- Test automation for both API and UI testing in a single project.
- Easy-to-read and expressive test scripts using the Gherkin syntax.
- Support for RESTful API testing with request and response validation.
- Interaction with web applications through Selenium WebDriver integration.
- Examples of common test scenarios and best practices for Karate automation.
- Cross-browser testing capabilities for UI tests.
